# Cracking-the-Coding-Interview-
A collection of my solutions and notes to the problems presented in the famous book 'Cracking the Coding Interview'
-----

CTCI is a great book to prepare for coding interviews - give all credit to the author: Gayle Laakmann McDowell for writing such a useful resource. 

For each of the questions I will be implementing the solutions in JavaScript unless the question 
explicitly asks for a different language; as I feel that is my strongest language and I typically interview in JavaScript. Each file will be named CTCI_n.js where n is the number corresponding to the question in the order I'm doing these. Each file will have my own original thoughts that I write down _as I'm thinking them_, the source code solutions I come up with, notes about what I missed when I looked at McDowell's solution, and then any other misc. thoughts I have. 

This serves to motivate me to complete at least a problem a day. Hopefully it will also help others who stumble upon the repo!
